#TechAyurveda.

Welcome to my blog...

I am here to introduce you to TechAyurveda.

So now what does the TechAyurveda means?
TechAyurveda is the playful collaboration of Modern Technology and Ancient Ayurveda.

So my view is there are many such things in India's history which are unbeatable.
And i took one example from that which is Ayurveda told by "Rishis" of Hindusthan.    
Journey of Ayurveda started before 5000 years. And still is unbeatable to any medical pathy.
I'm glad to say you that any kind of disease like cancer, kidney failure, heart related diseases and so on
can be cure by Ayurveda.
so I thought that what if there is collab between Modern Technology and Ancient Ayurveda...

There are some "Panchkarmas" in Ayurveda which requires lot's of hard work for better results.
So why don't we see it like an opprtunity?
Technology is always there to reduce your work.It will be more beneficial to Vaidyas...
One more interesting thing is Ayurvedic products.
From my own experience companies which are making Ayurvedic Products are compromising the quality of products.
So people prefer to buy these products from vaidyas which is made by himself.
But again there is work and stress. Not only that but the quantity made by vaidyas are also limited.
So I am suggesting that instead of doing manually, prefer an instrument for it.

There are many opportunities for Technology in Ayurveda. The only thing is enthusiasm and dedication to do something beyond the world without the limit of sky also....






#immunitybooster Chyavanprash...

So today's my topic is Chyavanprash...
Now in the World the one and only topic to discus is "CORONA"
And I'm also now going to talk about this...
I talked it before that we need collaboration between Technology and Ayurveda.
The reason I'm again talking this is the current situation in the world.
there's no medicine to cure CORONA in any pathy. I'm not saying that Ayurveda has that medicine to cure that... 
but Ayurveda knows how to boost up your immunity... and Ayurveda knows that if there's disease caused by anything then its not because of that virus and bacteria and something else
its because of the immunity weakness of your body...
And what is the use of Chyavanprash? to increase immunity 10 times!

So the conclusion is I found the opportunity to make an Instrument of making Chyavanprash uder the guidance of vaidyas....
