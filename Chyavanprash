#TechAyurveda

Welcome to my blog...

So today's my topic is Chyavanprash...
Now in the World the one and only topic to discus is "CORONA"
And I'm also now going to talk about this...
I talked it before that we need collaboration between Technology and Ayurveda.
The reason I'm again talking this is the current situation in the world.
there's no medicine to cure CORONA in any pathy. I'm not saying that Ayurveda has that medicine to cure that... 
but Ayurveda knows how to boost up your immunity... and Ayurveda knows that if there's disease caused by anything then its not because of that virus and bacteria and something else
its because of the immunity weakness of your body...
And what is the use of Chyavanprash? to increase immunity 10 times!

So the conclusion is I found the opportunity to make an Instrument of making Chyavanprash uder the guidance of vaidyas....
